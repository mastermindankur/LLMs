# Fine-Tuning Llama-3.2-1B Model with LoRA

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B` model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques. The training is conducted on a dataset hosted on Hugging Face and optimized for a T4 processor in Google Colab.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is hosted at [mastermindankur/results](https://huggingface.co/mastermindankur/results). It contains various text samples suitable for the training objectives of the Llama model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- LoRA implementation
- Google Colab (recommended for training on T4)

## Memory Requirement of a LLM

To calculate the memory requirement for fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM), we need to account for the following main components: model parameters, activations, gradients, and optimizer states. Here’s a formula you can use, with details on each component to help you adjust it for your specific model size, precision, and batch size.

Memory Requirement Formula
### Memory Usage in Deep Learning

The total memory requirement \( M_{\text{total}} \) in deep learning can be defined as:

\[
M_{\text{total}} = M_{\text{parameters}} + M_{\text{activations}} + M_{\text{gradients}} + M_{\text{optimizer}}
\]

Where:

- \( M_{\text{parameters}} \): Memory required to store model parameters.
- \( M_{\text{activations}} \): Memory required for storing activations during forward pass.
- \( M_{\text{gradients}} \): Memory required for gradients during backpropagation.
- \( M_{\text{optimizer}} \): Memory used by the optimizer for additional calculations.


Breaking Down Each Component

1. Memory for Model Parameters ￼

	•	Formula: ￼
	•	Explanation:
	•	num_parameters: Total number of parameters in the model.
	•	bytes_per_parameter: Memory per parameter, typically 2 bytes for FP16 (mixed precision) or 4 bytes for FP32 (full precision).

2. Memory for Activations ￼

	•	Formula: ￼
	•	Explanation:
	•	batch_size: Number of samples processed in one forward/backward pass.
	•	seq_length: Number of tokens in each sample (e.g., 512, 1024, or 2048).
	•	hidden_size: Dimensionality of the model’s hidden layers.
	•	num_layers: Total number of layers in the model.
	•	bytes_per_activation: Memory per activation, typically 2 bytes for FP16 or 4 bytes for FP32.
	•	Note: Activations are stored temporarily during training to compute gradients in the backward pass. Enabling gradient checkpointing can reduce this requirement by recomputing activations as needed, at the cost of additional computation time.

3. Memory for Gradients ￼

	•	Formula: ￼
	•	Explanation:
	•	Gradients for each parameter are stored in memory during training, so the memory needed for gradients is roughly equivalent to the memory for model parameters.
	•	This component is required for backpropagation but does not need additional storage beyond the size of the model parameters.

4. Memory for Optimizer States ￼

	•	Formula: ￼
	•	Explanation:
	•	bytes_per_optimizer_state: Memory per state variable, typically 2 bytes for FP16 or 4 bytes for FP32.
	•	num_optimizer_states: Number of states required by the optimizer (Adam/AdamW uses 2 states per parameter: mean and variance).
	•	Example: For Adam/AdamW, num_optimizer_states is 2, so the optimizer memory is roughly twice the model parameter memory.

Putting It All Together

Using the above formulas, here’s an overall formula you can use:

Example Calculation for a 7B Parameter Model in Mixed Precision (FP16)

Assuming:

	•	Parameters: 7 billion
	•	Precision: FP16 (2 bytes per parameter)
	•	Batch size: 2
	•	Sequence length: 1024 tokens
	•	Hidden size: 4096
	•	Number of layers: 32
	•	Optimizer: AdamW (2 states per parameter)

	1.	Model Parameters: ￼
	2.	Activations: ￼
	3.	Gradients: Same as model parameters: ￼
	4.	Optimizer States: ￼

This 56.5 GB estimate assumes no memory optimizations beyond FP16 precision. Techniques like gradient checkpointing and activation offloading can reduce activation memory further, helping fit large models into more practical configurations.
