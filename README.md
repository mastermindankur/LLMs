# Fine-Tuning Llama-3.2-1B Model with LoRA

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B` model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques. The training is conducted on a dataset hosted on Hugging Face and optimized for a T4 processor in Google Colab.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is hosted at [mastermindankur/results](https://huggingface.co/mastermindankur/results). It contains various text samples suitable for the training objectives of the Llama model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- LoRA implementation
- Google Colab (recommended for training on T4)
